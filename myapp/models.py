# by default, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller. 
# If the callerâ€™s transaction rolls back, the database changes made inside the signal also roll back.
# If the transaction fails, all changes made by the signal are rolled back.
# This prevents inconsistent data in the database.
# Django ensures data consistency by making signals part of the main transaction.
